This project formed the basis of my M.Phil dissertation written in 2019 on "The Utility of Automated Mis-/Disinformation Detection".
The dataset is a subset of the Webis-Buzzfeed Fake News Corpus available at:
https://webis.de/data/buzzfeed-webis-fake-news-16.html.
The data subset used in this project is text-only.
